  types, and cross-datastore consistency for tables mirrored into
  Redis/MongoDB. Also TRIGGERS when asked to audit the entire migration history for

# Database Reviewer Skill

Review the PostgreSQL schema of the JPPhotoManager web backend: Flyway
migrations (`backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`), JPA entities
(`infrastructure/persistence/entity/`), and the queries issued against them
(`infrastructure/persistence/jpa/*Repository.java`,
`infrastructure/persistence/adapter/*RepositoryImpl.java`). `asset_exif` and
`asset_audit_log` live in MongoDB and `refresh_tokens` is mirrored into Redis
— both are out of scope for this skill (schema-less/NoSQL); review those with
`java-developer`'s conventions instead, not this one.

This skill covers two distinct workflows:

- **Review** (below) — produce findings and a dated report. This is the
  default when reviewing a new/changed migration or entity.
- **Fix** (§8) — work through the findings in an *existing* dated report,
  fixing them and checking them off. Use this when asked to fix, address, or
  resolve issues from a report rather than to review the schema.

## Workflow

1. Identify the **scope**: a full audit of every migration under
   `db/migration/` (and every entity/repository that reads those tables), or
   a scoped review (one new migration, one entity, one repository).
2. Read every migration file in scope **in filename order** (`V{n}__*.sql`,
   sorted numerically, not alphabetically — `V9` comes before `V10`) — schema
   history is cumulative, so a column added in `V7` may be altered in `V14`
   and indexed in `V32`; reviewing a migration in isolation misses that.
3. For each table touched, find every repository method (`@Query`,
   Spring-Data derived query, or native query) that reads or writes it, and
   check whether the query's `WHERE`/`JOIN`/`ORDER BY`/`GROUP BY` columns are
   covered by an actual index (§3) — not just plausible-looking ones.
4. Cross-check `@Table(indexes = ...)` / `@Index` annotations on the JPA
   entity against what the migrations actually created (§3.4) — Hibernate
   `ddl-auto` is `validate`/`none` in this project, so entity-level index
   annotations are metadata only; they do not create anything, and can drift
   silently from the real schema.
5. Work through the checklist below, section by section.
6. Report findings grouped by **severity**, then by file.
7. Summarise with a short verdict and the top action items, then write the
   full report to a new, dated markdown file — see "Review Report Format &
   Output File" (§7) below. Do this on every run, not just full audits: a
   single-migration review still gets its own dated report.

Severity levels:

| Level             | Meaning                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 **CRITICAL**   | Data integrity risk, a query that will corrupt or silently drop data, or a full table scan on a hot path at current/expected row counts. Must be fixed before merging. |
| 🟡 **WARNING**    | Violates a project schema standard, causes avoidable query cost, or will cause maintainability/drift problems. Should be fixed. |
| 🟢 **SUGGESTION** | Style preference, minor normalization nit, or hardening idea. Fix if convenient.             |

---

## 1. Normalization

🔴 Flag a new column that duplicates data already derivable from a join
(e.g., storing `folder_path` directly on `assets` when `assets.folder_id →
folders.path` already gives it) — the two can drift out of sync on update.

🟡 Flag a repeating group implemented as multiple similarly-named columns
(`tag_1`, `tag_2`, `tag_3`) instead of a join table — the project's own
`tags`/`asset_tags` (`V13__create_tags_tables.sql`) is the reference pattern
for a proper many-to-many.

🟡 Flag a new many-to-many relationship modeled as a comma-separated or JSON
list of IDs in a single column instead of a join table, unless the values are
genuinely never queried/filtered individually (e.g. `albums.filter_json` in
`V18__add_smart_albums.sql` is opaque application-defined criteria, not a set
of foreign keys, so JSONB is the right call there — don't flag that as a
normalization violation).

🟢 Flag over-normalization: a lookup table with a fixed, small (<10), rarely
changing set of values that's only ever referenced from one table might be
better as a `CHECK` constraint or enum column (see `ProcessingStatus`,
`FileType`, `ImageRotation` — all stored as `VARCHAR` + `@Enumerated(STRING)`,
not as separate lookup tables — that's the project's existing convention for
small closed sets).

## 2. Column Naming & Data Types

### 2.1 Naming

| Element                | Expected                                        | Example                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Table                  | `snake_case`, plural                              | `assets`, `refresh_tokens`, `album_assets` |
| Join/association table | `{singular_a}_{singular_b}` (alphabetical or natural read order) | `asset_tags`, `album_assets` |
| Primary key column     | `{table_singular}_id`, `BIGSERIAL`/`SERIAL`       | `asset_id`, `folder_id`, `album_id`       |
| Foreign key column     | Same name as the referenced table's PK column     | `folder_id` referencing `folders.folder_id` |
| Boolean column         | `is_`/`has_` prefix or a clearly boolean noun      | `is_video`, `revoked`, `include_sub_folders` |
| Timestamp column       | `_at` suffix                                      | `created_at`, `deleted_at`, `hash_completed_at` |
| Index name             | `ix_{table}_{column(s)}`                          | `ix_assets_folder_id`, `ix_assets_processing_status` |
| Unique index name      | `uq_{table}_{column(s)}`                          | `uq_refresh_tokens_token`                 |
| Foreign key constraint | inline `REFERENCES` is fine; named constraints use `fk_{table}_{column}` | — |
| Composite PK constraint | `pk_{table}`                                     | `pk_album_assets`                         |

🟡 Flag any new table whose primary key column is bare `id` instead of
`{table_singular}_id`. **Known drift:** `users.id` (`V4__add_users.sql`) is
already inconsistent with every other table (`asset_id`, `folder_id`,
`album_id`, `token_id`, …) — don't propagate that pattern to new tables, and
call it out as a pre-existing `🟢 Suggestion` (not a blocking finding) if it
resurfaces in a full audit, since renaming a live PK used as an FK target
(`refresh_tokens.user_id`, `albums.user_id`, `user_preferences.user_id`, …)
is a breaking, multi-migration change, not a quick fix.

🔴 Flag any new index or constraint that doesn't follow the `ix_`/`uq_`/`fk_`/
`pk_` prefix convention above.

### 2.2 Data types

🔴 Flag `TIMESTAMP` (no time zone) on a **new** table when every other
recently-added table uses `TIMESTAMPTZ` (`refresh_tokens`, `user_preferences`,
`albums`, `album_assets` all use `TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`).
**Known drift:** `assets.*_date_time` and `folders`/early tables predate this
convention and use bare `TIMESTAMP` — don't require a data migration to fix
retroactively, but never add a new `TIMESTAMP` column going forward.

🟡 Flag `VARCHAR` without an explicit length (`VARCHAR(255)` etc.) when the
column has a genuine natural bound (usernames, enum-backed status columns,
theme names) — unbounded `TEXT` is fine for free-form content (`description`,
`path`, `token`) but an unbounded `VARCHAR` with no length is neither.

🟡 Flag a foreign key column whose type doesn't match its referenced PK's
type exactly (e.g. an `INTEGER` FK pointing at a `BIGSERIAL`/`BIGINT` PK, or a
`VARCHAR` FK pointing at a `UUID` PK).

🟡 Flag a new enum-like status/rotation/rating column stored as free-text
`VARCHAR` without a `CHECK` constraint **and** without a corresponding
`@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)` domain enum on the entity — one of the two
must constrain the value set, or invalid strings will silently persist.

🟢 Flag `SERIAL`/`INTEGER` primary keys on a new table expected to grow large
(anything asset-scoped) — prefer `BIGSERIAL`/`BIGINT` to avoid a future
int32-overflow migration. (`tags.tag_id` is `SERIAL` — acceptable since the
tag vocabulary is inherently small and bounded, unlike `assets`.)

---

## 3. Indexes

### 3.1 Coverage for foreign keys

🔴 Flag any new `FOREIGN KEY`/`REFERENCES` column that has no index. Postgres
does **not** auto-index FK columns (only the referenced side gets one via its
PK); every FK in this schema needs an explicit `CREATE INDEX` — see
`ix_assets_folder_id`, `ix_albums_user_id`, `ix_refresh_tokens_user_id`,
`ix_search_presets_user_id` for the existing pattern.

### 3.2 Coverage for query predicates

🔴 Flag a column that appears in a repository's `WHERE`, `JOIN ... ON`, or
`GROUP BY` clause on a table with non-trivial expected row count (`assets`
above all — this is a photo catalog, rows are expected in the tens/hundreds
of thousands) and has no supporting index. Concretely check every `@Query` in
`JpaAssetRepository`/`JpaFolderRepository` against the indexes actually
created by migrations, not against what `@Table(indexes=...)` claims (§3.4).
Known example to verify hasn't regressed: `AssetEntity.hash` is queried by
`findByHash` (`WHERE a.hash = :hash`) and by the duplicate-detection queries
(`GROUP BY a.hash HAVING COUNT(a) > 1`, and the correlated subquery in
`countDuplicates`) but as of this schema has **no index** — flag this as 🔴 if
still true, since duplicate detection runs a full sequential scan of `assets`
on every call.

🟡 Flag a query that filters or joins on a column covered only by a
*composite* index where the queried column isn't the leftmost member (a
leftmost-prefix violation) — e.g. a hypothetical lookup by `tag_id` alone
against `asset_tags`, whose only index is the composite PK
`(asset_id, tag_id)` — the PK covers "find tags for an asset" but not "find
assets for a tag" without a sequential scan.

🟡 Flag a `LIKE`/`ILIKE` prefix query (`... LIKE :value%`, no leading `%`)
against an unindexed `TEXT`/`VARCHAR` column — a plain B-tree index still
helps a left-anchored pattern. Known example to verify: `JpaFolderRepository`
has both `findByPath(String path)` and a prefix query
(`WHERE f.path LIKE :parentPath%`) against `folders.path`, which has no index
beyond the `folder_id` primary key — flag as 🟡 (not 🔴, since the `folders`
table itself is small; escalate to 🔴 only if it's joined against a
large table in the same query).

🟢 Flag a `LIKE '%value%'` (leading wildcard) query and note that a plain
B-tree index cannot help it — a `pg_trgm` GIN index would be the fix, but
only worth flagging as a suggestion since it's a bigger infrastructure change
(new extension) than a routine index addition.

### 3.3 Partial and covering indexes

🟢 Suggest a partial index (`WHERE` clause on the `CREATE INDEX` itself) when
a boolean/nullable column is queried almost exclusively for one value — the
existing `ix_albums_filter_json_not_null` (`V18`, indexing rows only `WHERE
filter_json IS NOT NULL`) and the implicit pattern behind
`ix_assets_deleted_at`/`ix_assets_processing_status` (queried mostly for
"active" or "pending" rows) are the reference examples. Don't insist on
converting an existing full index to partial unless a review specifically
asks for an index optimization pass — this is a suggestion, not a defect.

🟢 Flag redundant indexes: two indexes on the same table where one's column
list is a strict prefix of the other's — the shorter one adds write overhead
with no read benefit Postgres wouldn't get from the longer index alone.

### 3.4 Entity/migration index drift

🟡 Flag any `@Index`/`@Table(indexes = ...)` entry on a JPA entity that has
**no** corresponding `CREATE INDEX` in any migration — since `ddl-auto` is
`validate`/`none` here, the annotation creates nothing; it's misleading
documentation at best, and a developer reading only the entity will believe
an index exists that doesn't.

🟡 Flag the reverse: a migration-created index on a column with no matching
`@Index` entry on the entity — not wrong, but worth surfacing so the entity's
index list stays a trustworthy mirror of the real schema. Known example to
verify hasn't regressed: `AssetEntity`'s `@Table(indexes = ...)` currently
lists `ix_assets_folder_id` and `ix_assets_processing_status` but omits
`ix_assets_deleted_at` and `ix_assets_rating`, both of which exist in
migrations (`V10`, `V11`) — flag as 🟡 if still missing.

---

## 4. Views & Functions

The schema currently has **no** `CREATE VIEW`/`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` or
`CREATE FUNCTION` in any migration — every derived/aggregated read (home
dashboard stats, duplicate grouping, storage-by-folder, format breakdown) is
done via JPQL projections in `JpaAssetRepository` (`FolderAssetCount`,
`FormatProjection`, `MonthlyCountProjection`, `RatingProjection`,
`FolderStorageProjection`) instead. If a migration introduces the first
view/function, apply:

🔴 Flag a `CREATE FUNCTION` written in `PL/pgSQL` when the same logic could be
a plain JPQL/native `@Query` — functions move logic out of version-controlled
Java into the database, which this project's existing style deliberately
avoids (see the projection interfaces above). Only justify a DB function for
something a query genuinely cannot express (e.g. recursive CTEs for a folder
tree, which the current `LIKE :parentPath%` approach in `JpaFolderRepository`
approximates without one).

🔴 Flag any function created `SECURITY DEFINER` without an explicit,
commented justification — it executes with the privileges of the function's
owner, not the caller.

🟡 Flag a `CREATE VIEW` that is not `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` — plain
`CREATE VIEW` fails on a rerun/rollback-and-reapply and can't be
version-bumped in place; every later migration touching it must re-issue
`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` with the full definition, since Postgres has no
`ALTER VIEW ... ADD COLUMN`.

🟡 Flag a materialized view added without a corresponding refresh strategy
(a scheduled job, or a trigger) — an unrefreshed materialized view silently
serves stale data forever.

🟢 Flag a view or function name that doesn't follow `snake_case` matching the
table naming convention in §2.1.

---

## 5. Migration Mechanics

🔴 Flag any modification to an **existing, already-applied** migration file
under `db/migration/` — once applied, a migration's content and checksum are
fixed; Flyway will refuse to start if a checksum mismatches. Any change goes
in a new `V{n+1}__*.sql` instead. (This mirrors `code-reviewer` §6 — restated
here because it's the single most consequential mistake in this area.)

🟡 Flag a migration filename that doesn't follow `V{n}__{Description}.sql`
(two underscores after the version, `Description` in `Snake_Case` or
`lower_snake_case` matching the existing files — e.g.
`V14__add_file_type_to_assets.sql`, not `V14_addFileTypeToAssets.sql`).

🟡 Flag a new version number that isn't the next sequential integer after the
highest existing `V{n}` in `db/migration/` — check the actual highest version
present (not just the highest-numbered file matching a guess), since this
schema's versions are not contiguous by *filename sort* alone (e.g. `V1` sorts
after `V10`–`V19` alphabetically; always compare the numeric value).

🔴 Flag a new `@Column(nullable = false)` on an entity with no matching
`NOT NULL` (or a `NOT NULL` added via a follow-up `ALTER TABLE ... SET NOT
NULL`) in a migration, or the reverse — entity nullability and the actual
column constraint must agree, or Hibernate will either reject valid nulls
the DB allows, or let invalid nulls through that the DB would have rejected
had `ddl-auto` been more than `validate`.

🟡 Flag a migration that adds a `NOT NULL` column to an existing populated
table without either a `DEFAULT` or a backfill `UPDATE` in the same
migration — this project's own `V32__add_asset_processing_status.sql` shows
the right shape (`ADD COLUMN processing_status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT
'COMPLETED'`), avoiding a separate backfill step entirely.

🟡 Flag a single migration that both alters schema **and** performs a
large data backfill via `UPDATE` on a large table (`assets`) without
considering lock duration — prefer a `DEFAULT` (as above) over an
`UPDATE ... SET` touching every row when the two are equivalent in outcome.

🟢 Flag a migration that could have used `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` (as
`V1__initial_schema.sql` does for `ix_assets_folder_id`) instead of a bare
`CREATE INDEX`, for migrations whose idempotency matters for re-run
resilience — not required project-wide, but consistent with the one
precedent that exists.

---

## 6. Foreign Key & Cascade Behavior

🔴 Flag a foreign key with no `ON DELETE` clause where the parent row can
legitimately be deleted while children exist — Postgres defaults to
`ON DELETE NO ACTION`, which will throw at delete time instead of failing
the migration review. Every FK in this schema currently uses
`ON DELETE CASCADE` explicitly (`folders`→`assets`, `users`→`albums`/
`refresh_tokens`/`search_presets`/`user_preferences`, `assets`/`tags`→
`asset_tags`, `albums`/`assets`→`album_assets`) — match that unless the
relationship genuinely needs `RESTRICT`/`SET NULL` instead, and say why in
the migration if it deviates.

🟡 Flag `ON DELETE CASCADE` on a relationship where cascading would silently
destroy data the user would expect to survive (e.g. cascading an asset
delete into audit/history data) — cross-check against
`java-developer`/`CLAUDE.md`'s note that MongoDB `asset_exif`/
`asset_audit_log` deletion is handled explicitly in application code
precisely *because* Postgres cascade can't reach them; a new Postgres-side
cascade that duplicates or conflicts with an existing explicit-delete code
path is worth flagging.

### 6.3 Cross-Datastore Consistency

This project's data isn't confined to Postgres: `asset_audit_log` lives in
MongoDB, `refresh_tokens` is dual-written into Redis alongside its Postgres
table, and `asset_exif` has already migrated between Postgres and MongoDB
once (`mongodb-exif-store` → `revert-exif-postgres-jsonb`). A schema change
that touches a table with a presence in another store needs the same
scrutiny as an index or cascade change — a review that only checks the SQL
side can miss a consistency bug entirely.

🔴 Flag a migration or entity change to a table that is also mirrored into
another store (Redis, Mongo) when the change doesn't identify **which store
is authoritative for reads** post-change. `refresh_tokens` is explicit about
this today — Postgres remains authoritative for `findByToken`/
`deleteByUserId`/`deleteById` even though every write is mirrored into Redis
— a change that alters the write path without restating (or deliberately
changing) which side reads trust is a correctness risk, not just a
documentation gap.

🟡 Flag a new dual-write (a repository method that writes to Postgres and
also calls out to a Redis/Mongo store in the same method) that has no
comment or design-doc reference explaining why the mirror exists — every
existing one (`RedisRefreshTokenStore`, the Redis L2 thumbnail cache) is
tied to a named change (`redis-refresh-tokens`, `redis-thumbnail-cache`) with
a stated reason. An undocumented dual-write is hard for a future migration to
reason about — nobody can tell if dropping the Postgres column would break
the Redis mirror's contract, or vice versa.

🟡 Flag a schema change to a table whose data has previously lived in a
different store (per the migration history called out in
`JPPhotoManagerWeb/CLAUDE.md`) without checking whether the change should
also update that narrative — see the `web-docs-sync` skill. A reviewer
who only checks the migration file in isolation can miss that the change
continues or contradicts a documented prior migration between stores.

🟢 Suggest a `MongoIndexInitializer`-style startup-ensured index (compound
key + TTL, as used for `asset_audit_log`) when a new Mongo-backed collection
is introduced without one — Mongo has no Flyway-equivalent migration
tracking, so indexes need an explicit ensure-on-startup mechanism or they
simply won't exist outside whatever environment they were manually created
in.

---

## 7. Review Report Format & Output File

Structure the in-chat summary as follows:

```
## Database Review: <migration/entity/PR title>

### 🔴 Critical
- `db/migration/V33__....sql:5` — <issue description>

### 🟡 Warnings
- `entity/AssetEntity.java:16` — <issue description>

### 🟢 Suggestions
- `jpa/JpaFolderRepository.java:18` — <issue description>

### Verdict
<One or two sentences: overall schema health, whether it is safe to merge,
and the single most important thing to fix first.>
```

If there are no findings in a severity category, omit that category entirely.

### Write the report to a dated markdown file

Every time this skill runs — full audit or scoped review — also write the
findings to a new markdown file so work can be resumed later without
re-deriving context.

- **Path:** `docs/database-review/DATABASE_REVIEW_FINDINGS_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
  (repo root, today's date, ISO 8601). If a file for that date already exists
  (e.g. a second review the same day), append `-2`, `-3`, etc. before `.md`
  rather than overwriting the earlier run's report.
- This directory is gitignored — reports are local working artifacts, not
  committed history. Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet.
- **Content:** the same Critical/Warnings/Suggestions grouping as the in-chat
  summary, using GitHub task-list checkboxes (`- [ ]`) per finding instead of
  plain bullets, so items can be checked off as they're fixed. Include a
  short header noting the scope reviewed (full migration audit vs. a specific
  migration/entity/PR) and which commit/migration version the review was run
  against. Only include categories that have findings — omit empty ones.
- **Scope of content:** write only what was actually found in *this* run —
  don't carry forward unresolved items from a previous dated report by
  default.
- Do not overwrite or delete a previous dated report — each run's file is a
  point-in-time snapshot.

---

## 8. Fix Workflow

Use this workflow when asked to fix, address, resolve, or work through
findings from an **existing** dated report, instead of running a new review.
It is interactive and incremental: fix a chunk, check it off, ask what's
next. **This workflow never commits** — all changes stay uncommitted in the
working tree for the user to review and commit themselves.

### 8.1 Locate the report

1. If the user names a specific report file, skip straight to §8.2 with that
   file. Otherwise resolve a **date**: the date the user asked for, or
   (default) the most recent date that has any
   `docs/database-review/DATABASE_REVIEW_FINDINGS_*.md` file. If none exists,
   say so and stop — there is nothing to fix.
2. If multiple `-2`/`-3` reruns exist for that date, drop any that are fully
   checked off. If more than one remains, ask the user which to work on
   first, showing a rough Critical/Warning/Suggestion count for each.

### 8.2 Read the report, then ask what to fix

1. Read the full report before asking anything.
2. Ask the user whether they want to fix an entire severity category, or a
   specific finding — only offer categories/findings with unchecked (`- [ ]`)
   boxes remaining.

### 8.3 Fix loop

For the selected scope, work through each unchecked finding one at a time:

1. Read the affected migration/entity/repository file(s) in full context
   before changing anything.
2. Apply the fix:
   - **A fix to an already-applied migration is never "edit the file"** —
     per §5, create a new `V{n+1}__*.sql` that performs the correction
     (e.g. `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for a missing index, an `ALTER TABLE`
     for a data-type/nullability fix). Determine the next version number
     from the actual highest `V{n}` present, not a guess.
   - If the finding is purely on the JPA entity side (e.g. `@Table(indexes =
     ...)` drift from §3.4) and requires no schema change, editing the entity
     directly is fine — no new migration needed.
   - A finding that requires backfilling a large existing table
     (`assets`) needs a decision on batching/locking strategy; if it isn't
     obvious, stop and ask the user rather than picking one unilaterally
     (same rule as `code-reviewer` §17.3.3 / `security-reviewer` §9.3.3).
3. Verify the fix: run `mvn clean test-compile` at minimum; if the change
   affects schema applied to a Testcontainers-backed integration test, run
   the relevant integration test class (requires Docker) so Flyway actually
   applies the new migration against a real PostgreSQL instance rather than
   just compiling.
4. Update any repository tests whose expectations depended on the old
   schema/index shape.
5. Mark the finding complete in the report file immediately: change `- [ ]`
   to `- [x]` and append a bolded outcome note:
   - `**Fixed:** <what changed and why, one or two sentences>.`
   - `**Evaluated, no change made:** <rationale>` — for findings where the
     right call, after investigation, is to leave the schema as-is (e.g. a
     pre-existing drift like `users.id` that isn't worth a breaking rename).
6. If fixing one finding incidentally resolves another still-unchecked one
   (e.g. adding the missing `ix_assets_hash` index also fixes a related
   `@Table(indexes=...)` drift finding), check that one off too with a note
   explaining it was fixed as a byproduct.

### 8.4 Continue until done

After finishing the selected scope, run the widest verification available
(`mvn clean test` at minimum; `mvn verify -Pintegration-tests` if any
migration file changed, since only the Testcontainers-backed integration
suite actually exercises Flyway against real PostgreSQL) once before asking
what's next. Then:

- If the report still has unchecked findings, repeat from §8.2.
- If fully checked off, say so and stop.

Stop when the user says to stop, or when the report is fully checked off.

### 8.5 Never commit

Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, or any other state-changing git command
as part of this workflow. Leave all changes uncommitted so the user can
review the diff and commit it themselves.
