## Dependencies

### Hard implementation dependencies

**None.** Every improvement can be built and deployed independently.

### Soft implementation dependencies (order affects cleanliness)

**Improvement 11 → Improvement 7**

Both share the `findByFolderWithFilters` JPQL method in `AssetRepository`. If improvement 7 (search-and-filter) is implemented first, improvement 11 (star-ratings) simply extends the existing JPQL with an additional `minRating` predicate. If improvement 11 is implemented first, it must create the full method from scratch. The tasks.md for improvement 11 documents both paths explicitly.

### Functional dependencies (feature is significantly less useful without)

**Improvement 12 → Improvements 7 + 11**

Saved search presets store `{ search, dateFrom, dateTo, minRating }`. Without improvement 7, there are no `search`/`dateFrom`/`dateTo` filter fields to persist. Without improvement 11, there is no `minRating`. A preset system that can only store an empty object provides no practical value. Improvement 12 should be implemented after both 7 and 11 are in place.

### Deployment (migration) dependencies

Flyway migration versions must be applied in ascending order. Skipping a version causes Flyway to halt on startup. The planned migration sequence is:

| Migration | Feature                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| V7        | `exif-metadata-panel` — EXIF columns on `assets`            |
| V8        | `virtual-albums` — `albums` and `album_assets` tables       |
| V9        | `refresh-token` — `refresh_tokens` table                    |
| V10       | `soft-delete-recycle-bin` — `deleted_at` column on `assets` |
| V11       | `star-ratings` — `rating` column on `assets`                |
| V12       | `saved-search-presets` — `search_presets` table             |

Improvements that touch no database schema (2, 3, 5 frontend parts, 6, 8, 10) have no migration and no deployment ordering constraint relative to each other.

### Recommended implementation order

For a clean, incremental delivery the natural order within the data-model cluster is:

```
7 (search-and-filter) → 11 (star-ratings) → 12 (saved-search-presets)
```

All other improvements can be delivered in any order independently of this sequence and of each other.
