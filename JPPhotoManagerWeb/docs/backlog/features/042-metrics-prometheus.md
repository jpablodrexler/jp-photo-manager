# Feature 42 — metrics-prometheus

Add `micrometer-registry-prometheus` to `pom.xml` and expose `/actuator/prometheus`; instrument three application-specific metrics not covered by Spring Boot's default JVM/HTTP metrics: a `Timer` on catalog duration per folder, a `Timer` on thumbnail generation, and a `Gauge` tracking active SSE connections (catalog, sync, convert); add Prometheus and Grafana services to `docker-compose.yml` with a pre-built dashboard
