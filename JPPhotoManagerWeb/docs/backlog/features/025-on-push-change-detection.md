# Feature 25 — on-push-change-detection

Apply `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` to all 18 components; replace mutable state mutations with immutable assignments so Angular's OnPush check can detect changes; prioritise `ThumbnailComponent` (one instance per visible image) and `GalleryComponent` (the most complex); inject `ChangeDetectorRef` where manual `markForCheck()` calls are needed (e.g. after SSE events or async callbacks outside the Angular zone)
