# Feature 29 — exif-cache-service

Move the `Map<number, ExifMetadata | null>` from `ExifPanelComponent` (destroyed on every navigation) to a singleton `ExifCacheService`; the cache currently lives only for the lifetime of the component instance, so navigating away and back to the viewer discards all fetched EXIF data and triggers redundant API calls; a service-level cache persists for the entire session
