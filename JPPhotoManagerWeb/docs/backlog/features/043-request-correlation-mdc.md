# Feature 43 — request-correlation-mdc

Add a servlet `Filter` that injects a `requestId` UUID and the authenticated `username` into SLF4J `MDC` at the start of each request and clears it on completion; `logstash-logback-encoder` is already configured in `logback-spring.xml` and will automatically include both fields in every JSON log line; also set `X-Request-ID` on the response so the Angular frontend can log the correlation ID alongside client-side errors from `global-error-handler` (#36)
