# Feature 50 — image-comparison-viewer

Select exactly two assets in the gallery → "Compare" action opens a split-screen view showing both images side by side at matched zoom levels, with filename, size, dimensions, and rating displayed beneath each panel; most useful as a companion to the duplicates workflow but available from any multi-selection; no new backend endpoint — both images are served by the existing `GET /api/assets/{id}/image`; new `ComparisonViewerComponent` in `features/gallery/`
